RPA using UiPath
RPA can be leveraged and used to peoples advantage in the industry by automating repetitive processes that are supposed to be done by people in there workplaces. It saves individual people, businesses adn companies a lot of time rather doing the repetitive process over and over. After the automation is done, the processes will be done faster and more efficient than any human ever will do it.

In this project, I used UiPath to automate the add of records, edit of records and delete records from a database hosted on the web. The bot will add everything from the ecel sheet in no time, and it will also be able to edit what is commanded, and after the edit and add is done, there is also the option to delete the records.

No work is done by the individual, except for logging in and choosing the which sheet you want to modify. Thereafter you should choose what action you want to do with the sheet that you have chosen, meaning [Llayton Titus - 34416579 - Reference list.docx](https://github.com/CloaXy/CMPG323_Project4_34416579/files/13043828/Llayton.Titus.-.34416579.-.Reference.list.docx)
you choose between add a record, edit an existing record or deleting existing records.

Within the project there is an excel document to show if the testing has succeeded or not. When the "Testing" tab of each sheet in the excel file has the value of "True", it means that the test has succeeded and you are able to add records, edit records and delete records using the automation. When the Testing tab has a value of "False", it means that one of the three tests has failed. This hsows the project of the PRA and whether it was successful or not.
