# UiPath Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Project
Welcome to the UiPath Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Project repository! This project focuses on leveraging RPA using UiPath to automate repetitive tasks in the industry, particularly those related to data manipulation and management.

# Overview
Testing is a crucial part of any solution, and user acceptance testing (UAT) is often a manual process where testers ensure that the input entered into the solution generates the expected output. In many cases, UAT involves highly repetitive tasks that can be automated using RPA. This project aims to automate the user acceptance testing process for a web application developed in Project 3 using UiPath RPA.

# RPA Benefits
RPA using UiPath can significantly benefit individuals, businesses, and companies by automating time-consuming and repetitive tasks. By mimicking human tasks, RPA allows for faster and more efficient execution of processes, ultimately saving time and resources.

# Project Details
In this project, UiPath was used to automate the following tasks related to the web application developed in Project 3:

1. Adding Records: The bot adds records from an Excel sheet to the web application's database.

2. Editing Records: It is capable of editing existing records in the database based on commands.
 
3. Deleting Records: The bot can delete existing records from the database.

# Project Workflow
Login and Selection: The user logs in and selects the Excel sheet to modify.

Action Selection: The user chooses the action to perform (add, edit, or delete records).

Execution: The bot executes the chosen action on the selected Excel sheet, interacting with the web application as required.

Testing: The project includes an Excel document with a "Testing" tab. If the value is "True", the test has succeeded; if "False", one of the tests has failed.
